# Below are software and versions the GDK requires to operate correctly.
# Currently GDK itself (excluding other projects) requires the following
# software:
#
# * Ruby - The majority of GDK is written in Ruby.
# * Node.js - Linting tools GDK uses require Node.js.
# * Yarn - Supports Node.js.
# * Minio - Provides object storage for gitlab-org/gitlab Rails.
# * PostgreSQL - Provides RDBMS for gitlab-org/gitlab Rails/Sidekiq.
# * Redis - Provides data storage for gitlab-org/gitlab Rails/Sidekiq.
#
# Each project GDK manages should ideally provide its own .tool-versions
# file that contains the project's specific software and versions, resulting
# in the .tool-versions-gdk file containing _just_ GDK-only software requirements.
#
# New versions must be introduced alongside the current version, and are
# automatically installed by GDK for asdf users.
#
# This file is incorporated into .tool-versions via the support/asdf-combine
# script, which should be run when this file is updated.
#
# <default-version> <other-version>
