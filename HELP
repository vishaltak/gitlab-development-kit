  gdk thin                                  # Run Rails web server with thin in foreground
  gdk psql [-d gitlabhq_development]        # Run Postgres console

  gdk init                                  # Initialize GDK
  gdk install gitlab_repo=https://my-fork   # Install everything
  gdk update                                # Pull application changes from Git
  gdk reconfigure                           # Delete and regenerate all config files created by GDK

  gdk config get postgresql.port            # Get configuration values
  gdk diff-config                           # Print difference between current and new configuration values
  gdk trust /path/to/gdk                    # Mark an existing GDK as trusted

  gdk doctor                                # Run diagnostics on GDK
