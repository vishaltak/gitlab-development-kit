  gdk measure-workflow                      # Generate a sitespeed.io report for given workflow(s)

Manage GDK:

  gdk init                                  # Initialize GDK
  gdk install gitlab_repo=https://my-fork   # Install everything
  gdk update                                # Pull application changes from Git
  gdk reconfigure                           # Delete and regenerate all config
                                            #  files created by GDK

  gdk config get postgresql.port            # Get configuration values
  gdk config set postgresql.port <port>     # Set configuration values
  gdk diff-config                           # Print difference between current
                                            #  and new configuration values

  gdk reset-data                            # Backs up and creates fresh git
                                            #  repository, PostgreSQL data and
                                            #  Rails upload directory
  gdk pristine                              # Restore your GDK to a pristine
                                            #  state. Deletes caches, temporary files, and
                                            #  reinstalls dependencies. Does not delete data

  gdk doctor                                # Run diagnostics on GDK
  gdk version                               # Print current GDK version
