  gdk start redis postgresql                # Start specific services
  gdk stop                                  # Stop all services and unload Runit

  gdk restart                               # Restart everything
  gdk restart redis postgresql              # Restart specific services
  gdk kill                                  # Forcibly kills services

  gdk tail                                  # Tail all logs
  gdk tail redis postgresql                 # Tail specific logs

  gdk thin                                  # Run Rails web server with thin in
                                            #  foreground
  gdk psql [-d gitlabhq_development]        # Run Postgres console
  gdk psql-geo                              # Run Postgres console connected to the Geo tracking database
  gdk rails <command> [<args>]              # Execute provided command on Rails bundled with GitLab
  gdk redis-cli                             # Run Redis console

  gdk measure                               # Generate a sitespeed.io report for given URL(s)
  gdk measure-workflow                      # Generate a sitespeed.io report for given workflow(s)

Manage GDK:

  gdk open                                  # Visit your GitLab installation in your default web browser

  gdk install gitlab_repo=https://my-fork   # Install everything
  gdk update                                # Pull application changes from Git
  gdk reconfigure                           # Delete and regenerate all config
                                            #  files created by GDK

  gdk config get postgresql.port            # Get configuration values
  gdk config set postgresql.port <port>     # Set configuration values
  gdk diff-config                           # Print difference between current
                                            #  and new configuration values

  gdk reset-data                            # Backs up and creates fresh git
                                            #  repository, PostgreSQL data and
                                            #  Rails upload directory
  gdk reset-praefect-data                   # Backs up and creates fresh Praefect
                                            # PostgreSQL data
  gdk cleanup                               # Truncate log files and remove any
                                            #  unnecessarily installed dependencies
  gdk pristine                              # Restore your GDK to a pristine
                                            #  state. Deletes caches, temporary files, and
                                            #  reinstalls dependencies. Does not delete data

  gdk doctor                                # Run diagnostics on GDK
  gdk version                               # Print current GDK version
  gdk help                                  # Print this help text
