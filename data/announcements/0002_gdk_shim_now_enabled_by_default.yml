header: gdk Bash shim is now enabled by default
body: |
  With this change, we're setting the 'gdk.use_bash_shim' default to 'true'
  which means the 'gdk' command line tool will be Bash based, and installed as
  '/usr/local/bin/gdk'

  Both the Ruby and Bash version of the 'gdk' command line tool can co-exist
  but ideally you should remove the 'gitlab-development-kit' gem for all
  Ruby versions that are installed.

  See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/-/merge_requests/2881 for more details.
