header: GDK now supports error tracking and analytic data
body: |
  To improve GDK, GitLab would like to collect basic error and usage
  data to see how GDK is used and how it is performing.
  
  You can opt in to send error and analytic data to GitLab by running `gdk telemetry`.

  For more details, see
