# Advanced dependency instructions

The following are dependency installation instructions for systems other than
those covered in the [main dependency installation instructions](index.md#install-prerequisites).

These instructions may contain advanced configuration options.

## macOS

GDK supports macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) and later. To install dependencies for macOS:

1. [Install](https://brew.sh) Homebrew to get access to the `brew` command for package management.
1. Clone the [`gitlab-development-kit` project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit)
   so you have access to the project's
   [`Brewfile`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/-/blob/master/Brewfile).
   You can:
     - Reuse an existing checkout if you have one, but make sure it's up to date.
     - Use this check out again when you [install and set up GDK](index.md#install-and-set-up-gdk).
1. In the `gitlab-development-kit` checkout, run the following `brew` commands:

   ```shell
   brew bundle
   brew install git go postgresql@12 minio/stable/minio rbenv redis yarn
   ```

1. Add `/usr/local/opt/postgresql@12/bin` to your shell's `PATH` environment variable.
1. [Configure `rbenv`](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#homebrew-on-macos) for your shell.
1. Install [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating), and configure it for your
   shell.
1. Workaround [`thin` installation issues on macOS](https://github.com/macournoyer/thin/issues/365) by running:

   ```shell
   bundle config --local build.thin --with-cflags='"-Wno-error=implicit-function-declaration"'
   ```

## Ubuntu and Debian

The following are instructions for Ubuntu and Debian users that don't want
[GDK to manage their dependencies](index.md#install-dependencies).

These instructions help you install dependencies for Ubuntu, assuming you're using an active
LTS release (16.04, 18.04, 20.04) or higher, and Debian:

1. [Install `git` and `make`](index.md#install-prerequisites).
1. Install [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#debian-stable).
1. Run `make bootstrap-packages`. This is a light subset of `make bootstrap` that runs
   `apt-get update` and then `apt-get install` on the packages found in [`packages_debian.txt`](../packages_debian.txt).

   ```shell
   make bootstrap-packages
   ```

1. Install PostgreSQL and MinIO. Run the following commands:

   ```shell
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
   sudo curl "https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/linux-amd64/minio" --output /usr/local/bin/minio
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/minio
   ```

1. Check the required Go version in `.tool-versions`. You may be able to install the required
   version using `apt`. Check the available versions for:
    - [Ubuntu](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=golang-go).
    - [Debian](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=golang-go).
1. Install Go using one of the following methods:
   - If available for your version of Ubuntu or Debian, run `sudo apt install golang`.
   - If the required version is only available as a backport in [Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports),
     or [Debian](https://backports.debian.org/Instructions/#index2h2), use the backport package. You
     may need to update your `$PATH` so the backported version of Go is used.
   - If unavailable, install it manually. See the official [Go installation](https://golang.org/doc/install#install)
     instructions.

1. Check that `make bootstrap-packages` installed `redis-server` version 5.0 or newer (`apt list
   redis-server`). Install [Redis](https://redis.io) 5.0 or newer manually, if you don't already have
   it.
1. Install Ruby using [`rbenv`](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv). Install `rbenv`:

   ```shell
   sudo apt install rbenv
   ```

1. Run `rbenv init` to get instructions for what to add to your shell configuration file. For more
   information, see [the `rbenv` docs](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#how-rbenv-hooks-into-your-shell). Note:
   - If the required Ruby version in `.tool-versions` isn't installable, you need to get the
     [`ruby-build` plugin](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build#installation) and build it.
   - You need to select the Ruby version instead of your distributions default one (if any). See the
     [the `rbenv` instructions](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#choosing-the-ruby-version). For example,
     `echo 2.7.2 >~/.rbenv/version`.
1. [Complete](index.md#install-and-set-up-gdk) GDK installation.

## Install dependencies for other Linux distributions

The process for installing dependencies on Linux depends on your Linux distribution.

Unless already set, you might have to increase the watches limit of
`inotify` for frontend development tools such as `webpack` to effectively track
file changes. See [Inotify Watches Limit](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IDEADEV/Inotify+Watches+Limit)
for details and instructions about how to apply this change.

### Arch and Manjaro Linux

The following are instructions for Arch and Manjaro users that don't want
[GDK to manage their dependencies with `asdf`](index.md#install-dependencies).
These steps should also work for other
[Arch-based distribution](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch-based_distributions) that use systemd.

To install dependencies for Arch Linux:

1. [Install `git` and `make`](index.md#arch-and-manjaro-linux)

1. In the root of the `gitlab-development-kit` directory, run:

   ```shell
   sudo pacman -S $(sed -e 's/#.*//' packages_arch.txt)
   ```

1. [Install runit-systemd](#install-runit-on-arch-and-manjaro-linux).

#### Install runit on Arch and Manjaro Linux

The Arch Linux core repository no longer contains the `runit` package. You must
install [`runit-systemd`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/runit-systemd/) from the Arch User Repository (AUR).

If you're installing dependencies with [`asdf`](index.md#install-dependencies), `runit-systemd` is
installed as part of the `make bootstrap` command.

You can use an [AUR package helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers):

- For `pacaur` ([https://github.com/E5ten/pacaur](https://github.com/E5ten/pacaur)):

  ```shell
  pacaur -S runit-systemd
  ```

- For `pikaur` ([https://github.com/actionless/pikaur](https://github.com/actionless/pikaur)):

  ```shell
  pikaur -S runit-systemd
  ```

- For [`yay`](https://github.com/Jguer/yay):

  ```shell
  yay -S runit-systemd
  ```

### Fedora

NOTE:
These instructions don't account for using `asdf` for managing some dependencies.

We assume you are using Fedora >= 31.

NOTE:
Fedora 32 ships PostgreSQL 11.x and Fedora 32+ ships PostgreSQL 12.x in default repositories.
You can use `postgresql:11` or `postgresql:12` module to install PostgreSQL 11 or 12.
But keep in mind that replaces the default version of PostgreSQL package, so you cannot
use both versions at once.

```shell
sudo dnf module enable postgresql:12 # or postgresql:11
```

To install dependencies for Fedora:

```shell
sudo dnf install postgresql libpqxx-devel postgresql-libs redis libicu-devel \
  git git-lfs ed cmake rpm-build gcc-c++ krb5-devel go postgresql-server \
  postgresql-contrib postgresql-devel re2 GraphicsMagick re2-devel sqlite-devel \
  perl-Digest-SHA perl-Image-ExifTool rsync
sudo curl "https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/linux-amd64/minio" --output /usr/local/bin/minio
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/minio
```

You may need to install Redis 5.0 or newer manually.

#### runit

You also need to install [runit](http://smarden.org/runit) manually.

Although the following instructions work for runit version 2.1.2, be sure to
read the up-to-date installation instructions on [the website](http://smarden.org/runit)
before continuing.

1. Download and extract the runit source code to a local folder to compile it:

   ```shell
   wget http://smarden.org/runit/runit-2.1.2.tar.gz
   tar xzf runit-2.1.2.tar.gz
   cd admin/runit-2.1.2
   sed -i -E 's/ -static$//g' src/Makefile
   ./package/compile
   ./package/check
   ```

1. Ensure all binaries in `command/` are accessible from your `PATH` (for
   example, symlink / copy them to `/usr/local/bin`)

### CentOS

NOTE:
These instructions don't account for using `asdf` for managing some dependencies.

We assume you are using CentOS >= 8.

To install dependencies for CentOS (tested on CentOS 8.2):

```shell
sudo dnf module enable postgresql:12
sudo dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
sudo dnf install postgresql-server postgresql-devel libicu-devel git git-lfs cmake \
  gcc-c++ go redis ed fontconfig freetype libfreetype.so.6 libfontconfig.so.1 \
  libstdc++.so.6 npm re2 re2-devel GraphicsMagick perl-Image-ExifTool \
  rsync sqlite-devel
sudo curl "https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/linux-amd64/minio" --output /usr/local/bin/minio
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/minio

# This example uses Ruby 2.7.2. Substitute with the current version if different.
sudo rvm install 2.7.2
sudo rvm use 2.7.2
#Ensure your user is in rvm group
sudo usermod -a -G rvm <username>
#add iptables exceptions, or sudo service stop iptables
```

You need to follow [runit install instruction](#runit) to install it manually.

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux

NOTE:
These instructions don't account for using `asdf` for managing some dependencies, and
were tested on RHEL 8.3.

To install dependencies for RHEL:

```shell
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms
sudo dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
sudo dnf module install postgresql:12 redis:5 nodejs:14 go-toolset
sudo dnf install postgresql-server postgresql-devel libicu-devel git git-lfs cmake \
  gcc-c++ go redis ed fontconfig freetype libfreetype.so.6 libfontconfig.so.1 \
  libstdc++.so.6 npm re2 re2-devel GraphicsMagick perl-Image-ExifTool \
  rsync sqlite-devel
sudo curl "https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/linux-amd64/minio" --output /usr/local/bin/minio
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/minio

# This example uses Ruby 2.7.2. Substitute with the current version if different.
sudo rvm install 2.7.2
sudo rvm use 2.7.2
#Ensure your user is in rvm group
sudo usermod -a -G rvm <username>
#add iptables exceptions, or sudo service stop iptables
```

You need to follow [runit install instruction](#runit) to install it manually.

NOTE:
Although RHEL8 has a FIPS-compliant mode and GitLab can be installed with it
enabled, GitLab is not FIPS-compliant and will not run correctly with it
enabled. [Epic &5104](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5104) tracks
the status of GitLab FIPS compliance.

### OpenSUSE

NOTE:
These instructions don't account for using `asdf` for managing some dependencies.

This was tested on `openSUSE Tumbleweed (20200628)`.

NOTE:
OpenSUSE LEAP is currently not supported, because since a8e2f74d PostgreSQL 11+
is required, but `LEAP 15.1` includes PostgreSQL 10 only.

To install dependencies for OpenSUSE:

```shell
sudo zypper dup
# now reboot with "sudo init 6" if zypper reports:
# There are running programs which still use files and libraries deleted or updated by recent upgrades.
sudo zypper install libxslt-devel postgresql postgresql-devel libpqxx-devel redis libicu-devel git git-lfs ed cmake \
        rpm-build gcc-c++ krb5-devel postgresql-server postgresql-contrib \
        libxml2-devel libxml2-devel-32bit findutils-locate GraphicsMagick \
        exiftool rsync sqlite3-devel postgresql-server-devel \
        libgpg-error-devel libqgpgme-devel yarn curl wget re2-devel
sudo curl "https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/linux-amd64/minio" --output /usr/local/bin/minio
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/minio
```

Install `go` manually using [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) official installation instructions, for example:

```shell
curl -O "https://dl.google.com/go/go1.14.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz"
sudo tar xpzf go1.14.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /usr/local
```

Ensure that `node` has write permissions to install packages using:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/mynode/bin ~/mynode/lib
npm config set prefix ~/mynode
```

Install `runit` (it is no longer included in OpenSUSE):

```shell
wget http://smarden.org/runit/runit-2.1.2.tar.gz
tar xzf runit-2.1.2.tar.gz
cd admin/runit-2.1.2
sed -i -E 's/ -static$//g' src/Makefile
./package/compile
./package/check
sudo ./package/install
```

Set up local Ruby 2.7 environment (see [Ruby](#ruby) for details), for example
using [RVM](https://rvm.io/):

```shell
curl -sSL -o setup_rvm.sh "https://get.rvm.io"
chmod a+rx setup_rvm.sh
./setup_rvm.sh
source  /home/ansible/.rvm/scripts/rvm
rvm install 2.7.2
```

Append these lines to your `~/.bashrc`:

```shell
# to find binaries installed by yarn command
export PATH="$HOME/.yarn/bin:$PATH"
# to find sshd and redis-server in default path
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/sbin"
# to find go
export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH"
# local node packages
export PATH="$HOME/mynode/bin:$PATH"
# GDK is confused with OSTYPE=linux (suse default)
export OSTYPE=linux-gnu
```

And reload it using:

```shell
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now determine that the current Ruby version is 2.7.x:

```shell
ruby --version
ruby 2.7.2p137 (2020-10-01 revision 5445e04352) [x86_64-linux]
```

If it's different (for example Ruby 2.7 - system default in Tumbleweed), you
must sign in again.

The following `bundle config` options are recommended before you run
`gdk install` to avoid problems with the embedded libraries inside `nokogiri`
and `gpgme`:

```shell
bundle config build.nokogiri "--use-system-libraries" --global
bundle config build.gpgme --use-system-libraries
```

Now you can proceed to [set up GDK](index.md).

### Void linux

To run GDK on Void you need to install `ruby` with development headers, gem binary dependencies, `go`,
 `postgresql` with client, development headers and shared libraries, `sqlite`, `redis`:

 ```shell
sudo xbps-install -Su
sudo xbps-install ruby ruby-devel minio re2 re2-devel icu icu-libs icu-devel \
  go redis yarn GraphicsMagick sqlite sqlite-devel  pkg-config \
  postgresql13 postgresql13-client postgresql13-contrib postgresql-libs postgresql-libs-devel
 ```

## Install FreeBSD dependencies

To install dependencies for FreeBSD:

```shell
sudo pkg install postgresql10-server postgresql10-contrib postgresql-libpqxx \
redis go node icu krb5 gmake re2 GraphicsMagick p5-Image-ExifTool git-lfs minio sqlite3
```

## Install Windows 10 dependencies

> 🚨 Support for Windows 10 became stable with the introduction of the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) in version 2004.

**Setting up the Windows Subsystem for Linux:**

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

```shell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName VirtualMachinePlatform
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

Restart your computer when prompted.

Install your Linux distribution of choice using the Windows Store. The available
distribution options include:

- Ubuntu
- OpenSUSE
- SLES
- Kali Linux
- Debian GNU/Linux

Launch the distribution of choice.

You must ensure that your Linux distribution uses WSL version 2. Open PowerShell
with administrator privileges, and then run the following:

```shell
# If the command below does not return a list of your installed distributions,
# you have WS1.
wsl -l
```

You can [upgrade](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-kernel) your
WSL.

If you noticed your distribution of choice is an older subsystem, you can
upgrade it by running:

```shell
# Get the name of your subsystem
wsl -l
# Run the following command
wsl --set-version <your subsystem name here>
```

## Apply custom patches for Ruby

Some functions (and specs) require a special Ruby installed with additional [patches](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-build-images/-/tree/master/patches/ruby).
These patches are already applied when running on GitLab CI or when using GitLab Compose Kit,
but since GitLab Development Kit uses `asdf` they need to be manually enabled.

To recompile Ruby with adding additional patches do the following:

```shell
asdf uninstall ruby

# Compile Ruby 2.7.2
export RUBY_APPLY_PATCHES=https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-build-images/-/raw/master/patches/ruby/2.7.2/thread-memory-allocations-2.7.patch
asdf install ruby 2.7.2

# Compile Ruby 3.0.0
export RUBY_APPLY_PATCHES=https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-build-images/-/raw/master/patches/ruby/3.0.0/thread-memory-allocations-3.0.patch
asdf install ruby 3.0.0
```

You can later verify that patches were properly applied:

```shell
$ ruby -e 'puts Thread.trace_memory_allocations'
false
```

## Next Steps

After you've completed the steps on this page, [install and set up
GDK](index.md#install-and-set-up-gdk).
