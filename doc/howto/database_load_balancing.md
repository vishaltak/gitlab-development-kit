# Database load balancing

This document describes the required steps to enable and test the [database load balancing](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/database_load_balancing.html) feature in GDK.

To also test service discovery for database replicas, see the [database load balancing with service discovery documentation](database_load_balancing_with_service_discovery.md).

## Prerequisites

Database load balancing is an Enterprise feature, so you will need to generate a license for your GDK installation. See [Use GitLab Enterprise features](../index.md#use-gitlab-enterprise-features) for instructions.

## Assumptions

For these instructions, we assume that you are running all commands from the GDK root.

## Prepare

The first step is to prepare both primary and secondary databases for replication and enabling load balancing.

1. Initialize the secondary database:

    ```shell
    make postgresql-replication/data
    ```

1. Set up primary replication access and role:

    ```shell
    make postgresql-replication-primary
    ```

1. Remove the secondary database data as we will be replacing the data with that from the primary:

    ```shell
    rm -rf postgresql-replica/data/*
    ```

1. Copy data from primary to secondary with `pg_basebackup`:

    ```shell
    pg_basebackup -R -h $(pwd)/postgresql -D $(pwd)/postgresql-replica/data -P -U gitlab_replication --wal-method=fetch
    ```

   This automatically creates `postgresql.auto.conf` in the PostgreSQL data directory. Older
   versions stored this information in `recovery.conf`, a file that must be deleted for
   PostgreSQL 12 to function.

## Configure GDK

1. Edit `gdk.yml`:

   ```yaml
   postgresql:
     replica:
       enabled: true
   load_balancing:
     enabled: true
   ```

1. Reconfigure GDK:

    ```shell
    gdk reconfigure
    ```

1. Restart GDK:

    ```shell
    gdk restart
    ```

At this point you should see both a `postgresql` and a `postgresql-replica` service entry in the `gdk restart` output:

```plaintext
ok: run: ./services/postgresql: (pid 81204) 1s, normally down
ok: run: ./services/postgresql-replica: (pid 81202) 1s, normally down
```

Any data created in GitLab should now be replicated to the secondary database in realtime, and most `SELECT` queries should be routed to the secondary.

## Validate

Now that the databases were prepared for replication, we should validate whether the applied configurations produced the desired effect.

### Primary

1. Open a `psql` console:

    ```shell
    gdk psql
    ```

1. Enable expanded display mode:

    ```plaintext
    \x
    ```

1. Check `pg_stat_activity`:

    ```sql
    select * from pg_stat_activity where usename='gitlab_replication';
    ```

    You should see something like this:

    ```plaintext
    -[ RECORD 1 ]----+------------------------------
    datid            |
    datname          |
    pid              | 81890
    usesysid         | 39897
    usename          | gitlab_replication
    application_name | walreceiver
    client_addr      |
    client_hostname  |
    client_port      | -1
    backend_start    | 2021-01-14 16:56:56.190756+00
    xact_start       |
    query_start      |
    state_change     | 2021-01-14 16:56:56.192009+00
    wait_event_type  | Activity
    wait_event       | WalSenderMain
    state            | active
    backend_xid      |
    backend_xmin     |
    query            |
    backend_type     | walsender
    ```

### Secondary

Check the secondary logs with `gdk tail postgresql-replica`. You should see something like this:

```plaintext
2021-01-14_15:46:15.83178 postgresql-replica    : 2021-01-14 15:46:15.831 WET [60837] LOG:  listening on Unix socket "/full/path/to/gdk-root/postgresql-replica/.s.PGSQL.5432"

2021-01-14_15:46:15.88241 postgresql-replica    : 2021-01-14 15:46:15.882 WET [60991] LOG:  consistent recovery state reached at 0/6017678
2021-01-14_15:46:15.88274 postgresql-replica    : 2021-01-14 15:46:15.882 WET [60837] LOG:  database system is ready to accept read only connections
2021-01-14_15:47:13.89654 postgresql-replica    : 2021-01-14 15:47:13.896 WET [60991] LOG:  invalid record length at 0/6018598: wanted 24, got 0
2021-01-14_15:47:13.90324 postgresql-replica    : 2021-01-14 15:47:13.903 WET [61711] LOG:  started streaming WAL from primary at 0/6000000 on timeline 1
```

## Debug

Use these instructions if needing to debug database load balancing.

### Query log

If you want to see which queries go to primary and secondary, you can enable statement logging for each instance, editing `postgresql/data/postgresql.conf` and `postgresql-replica/data/postgresql.conf`, respectively:

```plaintext
log_statement = 'all'                        # none, ddl, mod, all
```

Once done, restart the instances with GDK and tail their logs.

### Simulating replication delay

You can simulate replication delay by adding a minimum delay. The
following setting in `postgresql-replica/data/postgresql.conf` delays
replication by at least 1 minute:

```plaintext
recovery_min_apply_delay = '1min'
```

When simulating replication delay, you may never be caught up if some process is constantly writing. If you find Praefect is constantly
updating some status, you can work around this by stopping Praefect temporarily with `gdk stop praefect`.
