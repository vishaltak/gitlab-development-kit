# GitLab Geo

This document will instruct you to set up GitLab Geo using GDK.

Geo allows you to replicate a whole GitLab instance. Customers use this for
Disaster Recovery, as well as to offload read-only requests to secondary
instances. For more, see
[GitLab Geo](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/geo/) or
[Replication (Geo)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/).

## Prerequisites

Development on GitLab Geo requires two GDK instances running side-by-side.
You can use an existing `gdk` instance based on the [Set up GDK](../set-up-gdk.md#develop-against-the-gitlab-project-default) documentation as the primary node.

### Secondary

Now we'll create a secondary instance in a `gdk-geo` folder to act as
a secondary node. We'll configure unique ports for the new instance so
that it can run alongside the primary.

```bash
gdk init gdk-geo
cd gdk-geo
```

Add the following to `gdk.yml` file:

```yaml
---
geo:
  enabled: true
gitlab_pages:
  enabled: enabled
  port: 3011
tracer:
  jaeger:
    enabled: false
port: 3001
webpack:
  host: 0.0.0.0
  port: 3809
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
# Assuming your primary GDK instance lives in parallel folders:
gdk install gitlab_repo=../gdk/gitlab
```

When seeding begins, cancel it (Ctrl-C) since we will delete the data anyway.

Then run the following commands:

```bash
gdk start postgresql
gdk start postgresql-geo
make geo-setup
```

## Database replication

For GitLab Geo, you will need a primary/secondary database replication defined.
There are a few extra steps to follow.

### Prepare primary for replication

In your primary instance (`gdk`) you need to prepare the database for
replication. This requires the PostgreSQL server to be running, so we'll start
the server, perform the change (via a `make` task), and then kill and restart
the server to pick up the change:

```bash
# terminal window 1:
cd gdk
gdk start postgresql
make postgresql-replication-primary
gdk restart postgresql
make postgresql-replication-primary-create-slot
gdk restart postgresql
```

### Set up replication on secondary

Because we'll be replicating the primary database to the secondary, we need to
remove the secondary's PostgreSQL data folder:

```bash
# terminal window 2:
cd gdk-geo
rm -r postgresql
```

Now we need to add a symbolic link to the primary instance's data folder:

```bash
# From the gdk-geo folder:
ln -s ../gdk/postgresql postgresql-primary
```

Initialize a secondary database and setup replication:

```bash
# terminal window 2:
make postgresql-replication-secondary
```

### Running tests

The secondary has a read-write tracking database, which is necessary for some
Geo tests to run. However, its copy of the replicated database is read-only, so
tests will fail to run.

You can add the tracking database to the primary node by running:

```bash
# From the gdk folder:
gdk start

# In another terminal window
make geo-setup
```

This will add both development and test instances, but the primary will continue
to operate *as* a primary except in tests where the current Geo node has been
stubbed.

To ensure the tracking database is started, restart GDK. You will need to use
`gdk start` to be able to run the tests.

## Copy database encryption key

The primary and the secondary nodes will be using the same secret key
to encrypt attributes in the database. To copy the secret from your primary to your secondary:

1. Open `gdk/gitlab/config/secrets.yml` with your editor of choice
1. Copy the value of `development.db_key_base`
1. Paste it into `gdk-geo/gitlab/config/secrets.yml`

## SSH cloning

To be able to clone over SSH on a secondary, follow the instruction on how
to set up [SSH](ssh.md), including [SSH key lookup from database](ssh.md#ssh-key-lookup-from-database).

## Configure Geo nodes

### Add primary node

There is a rake task that can add the primary node:

```bash
cd gdk/gitlab

bundle exec rake geo:set_primary_node
```

### Add secondary node

There isn't a convenient rake task to add the secondary node because the command
must be run on the secondary, but written on the primary. So we must get the
name and manually add the node. Open a terminal window on the secondary node.
This will output the secondary node's name.

```bash
cd gdk-geo/gitlab

bundle exec rails runner 'puts GeoNode.current_node_name'
```

1. Visit the **primary** node's **Admin Area âž” Geo Nodes** (`/admin/geo/nodes`)
   in your browser.
1. Click the **New node** button.
1. Using the *exact* output from the `puts GeoNode.current_node_name` command,
   fill in the **Name** and **URL** fields for the **secondary** node.
1. **Do not** check the box 'This is a primary node'.
1. Click the **Add node** button.

## Geo-specific GDK commands

### `make geo-primary-migrate`

Use this when your checked out files have changed, and e.g. your instance or
tests are now erroring. For example, after you pull master, but you don't care
to update dependencies right now. Or maybe you checked out someone else's
branch.

* Bundle installs to ensure gems are up-to-date
* Migrates main DB and tracking DB (be sure to run `make geo-secondary-migrate` on
your secondary if you have Geo migrations)
* Prepares main and tracking test DBs
* Checks out schemas to get rid of irrelevant diffs (not done in
   `make geo-primary-migrate` because you may have created a migration)

### `make geo-primary-update`

Same as `make geo-primary-migrate`, but also:

* Does `gdk update`
* Checks out and pulls master
* Updates dependencies (e.g. if Gitaly is erroring)
* Rebuilds FDW tables in test DB
* Finally does `gdk diff-config` so you can see a summary of how your configs
  differ from a fresh install

### `make geo-secondary-migrate`

Similar to `make geo-primary-migrate` but for your local secondary.

### `make geo-secondary-update`

Similar to `make geo-primary-update` but for your local secondary.

## Troubleshooting

### postgresql-geo/data exists but is not empty

If you see this error during setup because you have already run `make geo-setup` once:

```
initdb: directory "postgresql-geo/data" exists but is not empty
If you want to create a new database system, either remove or empty
the directory "postgresql-geo/data" or run initdb
with an argument other than "postgresql-geo/data".
make: *** [postgresql/geo] Error 1
```

Then you may delete or move that data in order to run `make geo-setup` again.

```bash
$ mv postgresql-geo/data postgresql-geo/data.backup
```

### FDW is no longer working even though you have it enabled, after migrations or `gdk update`

You need to rebuild FDW tables.

If your local primary is in `~/Developer/gdk`:

```bash
cd ~/Developer/gdk
gdk start
make postgresql/geo-fdw/test/rebuild
```

And if your local secondary is in `~/Developer/gdk-geo`:

```bash
cd ~/Developer/gdk-geo
gdk start
make postgresql/geo-fdw/development/rebuild
```
