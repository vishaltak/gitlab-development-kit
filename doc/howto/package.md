# Package

If you want to enable Package registry support (e.g. NPM, Maven, etc...) a license is required with a minimum level of Silver or Premium.

A license can be generated at [license.gitlab.com](https://license.gitlab.com) or by cloning and running the [License App](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/license-gitlab-com) locally.
