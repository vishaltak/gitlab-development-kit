# Package

[Package registry support](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/packages.html) requires a GitLab enterprise license with a minimum of [Silver or Premium tier](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/).

Refer to the Enterprise Edition [setup instructions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/blob/master/doc/set-up-gdk.md#gitlab-enterprise-edition) for information on enabling GDK for this tier and generating a license.
