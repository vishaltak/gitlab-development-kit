# Registry

To run the registry, you need [Docker](https://docker.com) installed.

## Enabling the registry

In your `gdk.yml`, set

```yaml
registry:
  enabled: true
  # See gdk.example.yml for a full set of options
```

and run `gdk reconfigure` to create or update the necessary configuration files.

You should now be able to run the registry with the `gdk start registry` command,
but for the changes to get picked up by your Rails environment, you must also run
the `gdk restart rails` command.

## Configuring the registry

### With the Auto DevOps QA tunnel

If you've previously followed the [Auto DevOps configuration steps](auto_devops/index.md),
you will have a secure registry *accessible from the internet* after you run the
`gdk restart tunnel` command.

Since the registry is on the internet, it should work with any runner registered with your GDK without additional steps.

### Configuring a local-only registry

If you do not want to use the tunnel-based workflow due to bandwidth restrictions
or lack of internet access, then you can use a local registry:

1. Update `gdk.yml` as follows:

    ```yaml
    auto_devops:
      enabled: false

    hostname: gdk.test

    registry:
      enabled: true
      host: gdk.test
      listen_address: '172.16.123.1' # your loopback alias
      self_signed: true  # or false, see below for details (default is false)
      auth_enabled: true # or false, see below for details (default is true)
    ```

    where `gdk.test` is configured according to [Obtaining a usable hostname](#obtaining-a-usable-hostname),
    and `172.16.123.1` is the corresponding loopback alias.

1. Run `gdk reconfigure` to update the configuration and generate certificate files
   for the local registry (`registry_host.crt` and `registry_host.key`) if needed.

1. If you set `registry.self_signed` to `true`, you should now:
    1. Configure Docker to [trust the registry's certificate](#trusting-the-registrys-self-signed-certificate).
    1. Configure any local runner to [mount the trusted certificates](#configuring-a-local-docker-based-runner).

1. If you set either `registry.self_signed` or `registry.auth_enabled` to `false`, your
   registry will be considered *insecure* by Docker and you must
   [explicitly allow it](https://docs.docker.com/registry/insecure/). For information
   on [using an insecure registry](#using-an-insecure-registry-from-gitlab-ci) using
   Docker-in-Docker, see the documentation.

NOTE:
When changing the hostname for a self-signed registry, you must run `gdk reconfigure` and
[update the trusted certificates in Docker](#trusting-the-registrys-self-signed-certificate).

After completing these instructions, you should be ready to work with the registry locally. See the
[Interacting with the local container registry](#interacting-with-the-local-container-registry)
section for examples of how to query the registry manually using `curl`.

## Tips and Tricks

### Obtaining a usable hostname

Since `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` have different meanings inside a Docker-based runner
than from your computer, a different host is required to access your GitLab instance and your registry.

One solution is to bind `gdk.test` to a loopback IP *alias* (*not*
`127.0.0.1`) in `/etc/hosts`. A loopback IP alias is like `127.0.0.1` (requests go
straight to your computer) but this IP will remain accessible from within a container
(unlike `127.0.0.1`). To set this up:

1. Follow the instructions to [set up an internal dummy interface](runner.md#using-an-internal-dummy-interface).
1. Point `gdk.test` to this new IP in your `/etc/hosts` file. For example:

   ```plaintext
   # Local network loopback alias
   #
   # create alias: sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 172.16.123.1
   # remove alias: sudo ifconfig lo0 -alias 172.16.123.1
   172.16.123.1 gdk.test
   ```

**Warning:** If for some reason you end up on a network with the loopback alias as
your local network IP, your GDK will become accessible on the local network.

NOTE:
If you're using `docker-machine`, you must replace this IP address with the one returned from
`docker-machine ip default`. See the [information about switching Docker runtimes](#switching-between-docker-desktop-on-mac-and-docker-machine)
for details.

### Trusting the registry's self-signed certificate

Since the registry is self-signed, Docker treats it as *insecure*. The certificate must be in your
GDK root, called `registry_host.crt`, and must be copied as `ca.crt` to the
[appropriate Docker configuration location](https://docs.docker.com/registry/insecure/#use-self-signed-certificates).

If you are using Docker Desktop for Mac, GDK includes the shorthand:

```shell
rm -f registry_host.{key,crt} && make trust-docker-registry
```

This will place the certificate under `~/.docker/certs.d/$REGISTRY_HOST:$REGISRY_PORT/ca.crt`, *overwriting any existing certificate* at that path.

Afterwards, you **must restart Docker** to apply the changes.

### Using an insecure registry from GitLab CI

If trusting the self-signed certificate is not an option, you can instruct Docker to consider the registry as insecure. For example, Docker-in-Docker builds require an additional flag, `--insecure-registry`:

```yaml
services:
  - name: docker:stable-dind
    command: ["--insecure-registry=gdk.test:5000"]
```

### Configuring a local Docker-based runner

For Docker-in-Docker builds to work in a local runner, you must also make the nested Docker
service trust the certificates by editing `volumes` under `[[runners.docker]]` in your
runner's `.toml` configuration to include:

```shell
$HOME/.docker/certs.d:/etc/docker/certs.d
```

replacing `$HOME` with the expanded path. For example

```toml
volumes = ["/Users/hfyngvason/.docker/certs.d:/etc/docker/certs.d", "/certs/client", "/cache"]
```

### Observing the registry

Execute `gdk tail` and notice the `registry` entries in the log output, for example:

```plaintext
registry   : level=warning msg="No HTTP secret provided - generated random secret ...
registry   : level=info msg="redis not configured" go.version=go1.11.2 ...
registry   : level=info msg="Starting upload purge in 13m0s" go.version=go1.11.2 ...
registry   : level=info msg="using inmemory blob descriptor cache" go.version=go1.11.2 ...
registry   : level=info msg="listening on [::]:5000" go.version=go1.11.2 ...
```

Use `docker ps` to see if there is a registry container running:

```shell
$ docker ps


CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                                                                    COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
61b7b150be33        registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/cng/gitlab-container-registry:v2.9.1-gitlab         "/entrypoint.sh /etcâ€¦"   2 minutes ago       Up 2 minutes        0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp   priceless_hoover
```

Visit `$REGISTRY_HOST:$REGISTRY_PORT` (such as `gdk.test:5000`) in your browser.
Any response, even a blank page, means that the registry is probably running. If the
registry is running, the output of `gdk tail` changes.

### Interacting with the local container registry

In this section, we assume you have obtained a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) with all permissions, and exported it as `GITLAB_TOKEN` in your environment:

```shell
export GITLAB_TOKEN=...
```

#### Using the Docker Client

- If you have authentication enabled, logging in is required.
- If you have a self-signed local registry, trusting the registry's certificates is required.

##### Log in to the registry

```shell
docker login gdk.test:5000 -u gitlab-token -p "$GITLAB_TOKEN"
```

##### Build and tag an image

```shell
docker build -t gdk.test:5000/custom-docker-image .
```

##### Push the image to the local registry

```shell
docker push gdk.test:5000/custom-docker-image
```

#### Using HTTP

- If you have a self-signed certificate, you can add `--cacert registry_host.crt` or `-k` to the `curl` commands.
- If you have authentication enabled, you need to obtain a bearer token for your requests:

  ```shell
  export GITLAB_REGISTRY_JWT=`curl "http://gitlab-token:$GITLAB_TOKEN@gdk.test:3000/jwt/auth?service=container_registry&scope=$SCOPE" | jq -r .token`
  ```

  where `$SCOPE` should be
  - `registry:catalog:*` to interact with the catalog
  - `repository:your/project/path:*` to interact with the images associated with a particular project

  Alternatively, you can obtain the token via the Rails console:

  ```ruby
  ::Auth::ContainerRegistryAuthenticationService.pull_access_token('your/project/path')
  ```

  To use the token, append it as a header flag to the `curl` command:

  ```shell
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITLAB_REGISTRY_JWT"
  ```

The commands below assume a self-signed registry with authentication enabled, as this is the most complicated use case.

##### Retrieve a list of images available in the repository

```shell
curl --cacert registry_host.crt -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITLAB_REGISTRY_JWT" \
  gdk.test:5000/v2/_catalog
```

```json
{
  "repositories": [
    "secure-group/docker-image-test",
    "secure-group/klar",
    "secure-group/tests/ruby-bundler/master",
    "testing",
    "ubuntu"
  ]
}
```

##### List tags for a specific image

```shell
curl --cacert registry_host.crt -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITLAB_REGISTRY_JWT" \
  gdk.test:5000/v2/secure-group/tests/ruby-bundler/master/tags/list
```

```json
{
  "tags": [
    "3bf5c8efcd276bf6133ccb787e54b7020a00b99c",

  ], "name": "secure-group/tests/ruby-bundler/master"
}
```

##### Get image manifest

```shell
curl --cacert registry_host.crt -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITLAB_REGISTRY_JWT" \
  gdk.test:5000/v2/secure-group/tests/ruby-bundler/master/manifests/3bf5c8efcd276bf6133ccb787e54b7020a00b99c

      },
  "..."
```

##### Get image layers

```

### Using a custom Docker image as the main pipeline build image

It's possible to use the local GitLab container registry as the source of the build image in
pipelines.

1. Create a new project called `custom-docker-image` with the following `Dockerfile`:

   ```dockerfile
   FROM alpine
   RUN apk add --no-cache --update curl
   ```

1. Build and tag an image from within the same directory as the `Dockerfile` for the project.

   ```shell
   docker build -t gdk.test:5000/custom-docker-image .
   ```

1. Push the image to the registry. (See [Configuring the GitLab Docker runner to automatically pull images](#configuring-the-gitlab-docker-runner-to-automatically-pull-images) for the preferred method which doesn't require you to constantly push the image after each change.)

   ```shell
   docker push gdk.test:5000/custom-docker-image
   ```

   You should follow the directions given in the [Configuring the GitLab Docker runner to automatically pull images](#configuring-the-gitlab-docker-runner-to-automatically-pull-images) section to avoid pushing images altogether.

1. Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` and add it to the Git repository for the project. Configure the `image` directive in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to reference the `custom-docker-image` which was tagged and pushed in previous steps:

   ```yaml
   image: gdk.test:5000/custom-docker-image

   stages:
     - test

   custom_docker_image_job:
     allow_failure: false
     script:
       - curl -I httpstat.us/201
   ```

1. The CI job should now pass and will execute the `curl` command which we previously added to our base image:

   ```shell
   # CI job log output
   curl -I httpstat.us/201

   HTTP/1.1 201 Created
   ```

### Configuring the GitLab Docker runner to automatically pull images

In order to avoid having to push the Docker image after every change, it's
possible to configure the GitLab Runner to automatically pull the image
if it isn't present. This can be done by setting `pull_policy = "if-not-present"`
in the Runner's config.

```toml
# ~/.gitlab-runner/config.toml

[[runners]]
  name = "docker-executor"
  url = "http://gdk.test:3000/"
  token = "<my-token>"
  executor = "docker"
  [runners.custom_build_dir]
  [runners.docker]
    image = "ruby:2.6.3"
    privileged = true
    # When the if-not-present pull policy is used, the Runner will first check if the image is present locally.
    # If it is, then the local version of image will be used. Otherwise, the Runner will try to pull the image.
    pull_policy = "if-not-present"
```

### Building and pushing images to your local GitLab container registry in a build step

It's sometimes necessary to use the local GitLab container registry in a pipeline. For
example, the [container scanning](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/container_scanning/#example)
feature requires a build step that builds and pushes a Docker image to the registry before it can analyze the image.

To add a custom `build` step as part of a pipeline for use in later jobs
such as container scanning, add the following to your `.gitlab-yml.ci`:

```yaml
image: docker:stable

services:
  - name: docker:stable-dind
    command: ["--insecure-registry=gdk.test:5000"] # Only required if the registry is insecure

stages:
  - build

build:
  stage: build
  variables:
    DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: ""
  script:
    # login only required if `auth_enabled: true`
    - docker login -u "$CI_REGISTRY_USER" -p "$CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD" "$CI_REGISTRY"
    - docker pull $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG:$CI_COMMIT_SHA || true
    - docker build -t $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG:$CI_COMMIT_SHA .
    - docker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
```

To verify that the build stage has successfully pushed an image to your local GitLab container registry, follow the instructions in the section [List tags for a specific image](#list-tags-for-a-specific-image)

**Some notes about the above `.gitlab-yml.ci` configuration file:**

- The variable `DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: ""` is required in the `build` stage because of a breaking change introduced by Docker 19.03, described [here](https://about.gitlab.com/2019/07/31/docker-in-docker-with-docker-19-dot-03/)
- It's only necessary to set `--insecure-registry=gdk.test:5000` for the `docker:stable-dind` if you have not set up a [trusted self-signed registry](#trusting-the-registrys-self-signed-certificate).

### Running container scanning on a local Docker image created by a build step in your pipeline

It's possible to use a `build` step to create a custom Docker image and then execute a
[container scan](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/klar) against this newly
built Docker image. This can be achieved by using the following `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
include:
  template: Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml

image: docker:stable

services:
  - name: docker:stable-dind
    command: ["--insecure-registry=gdk.test:5000"] # Only required if the registry is insecure

stages:
  - build
  - test

build:
  stage: build
  variables:
    DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: ""
  script:
    # login only required if `auth_enabled: true`
    - docker login -u "$CI_REGISTRY_USER" -p "$CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD" "$CI_REGISTRY"
    - docker pull $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG:$CI_COMMIT_SHA || true
    - docker build -t $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG:$CI_COMMIT_SHA .
    - docker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG:$CI_COMMIT_SHA

container_scanning:
  variables:
    REGISTRY_INSECURE: "true" # see note below for discussion
```

NOTE:
The contents of the above `.gitlab-ci.yml` file will differ depending on how the container registry has been configured:

1. When the local container registry is insecure because `registry.self_signed: false` has been [configured](#configuring-a-local-only-registry), the above `.gitlab-ci.yml` file can be used.

   It's necessary to set `REGISTRY_INSECURE: "true"` in the `container_scanning` job because the [container scanning tool](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/klar/) uses [klar](https://github.com/optiopay/klar) under the hood, and `klar` will attempt to fetch the image from our registry using `HTTPS`, meanwhile our registry is running insecurely over `HTTP`. Setting the `REGISTRY_INSECURE` flag of klar, documented in the klar repo [here](https://github.com/optiopay/klar#usage) and also in the GitLab container scanning repo [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/klar/#environment-variables) will force the `klar` tool to
use `HTTP` when fetching the container image from our insecure registry.

1. When the registry is secure because `registry.self_signed: true` has been [configured](#configuring-a-local-only-registry), but we haven't referenced the self-signed certificate, then the following `services` and `container_scanning` sections of the above `.gitlab-ci.yml` must be used (the rest of the file has been omitted for brevity):

   ```yaml
   services:
     - docker:stable-dind

   container_scanning:
     variables:
       DOCKER_INSECURE: "true"
   ```

   Since the local container registry is now running securely over an `HTTPS` connection, we no longer need to use `REGISTRY_INSECURE: "true"`. However, we need to set the `DOCKER_INSECURE: "true"` option to instruct [klar](https://github.com/optiopay/klar) (and [clair](https://github.com/coreos/clair)) to accept a self-signed certificate.

1. When the registry is secure because `registry.self_signed: true` has been [configured](#configuring-a-local-only-registry), **and** we reference the self-signed certificate, then the following `services` and `container_scanning` sections of the above `.gitlab-ci.yml` must be used (the rest of the file has been omitted for brevity):

   ```yaml
   services:
     - docker:stable-dind

   container_scanning:
     variables:
       ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE: "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- certificate-goes-here -----END CERTIFICATE-----"
   ```

   By configuring the `ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE`, this instructs [klar](https://github.com/optiopay/klar) (and [clair](https://github.com/coreos/clair)) to use the provided certificate when accessing the local container registry. Normally, the `ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE` would be [configured in the UI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#create-a-custom-variable-in-the-ui), but it's displayed here in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` for demonstration purposes.

### Switching Between `docker-desktop-on-mac` and `docker-machine`

To determine if you're using `docker-machine`, execute the following command:

```shell
export | grep -i docker

DOCKER_CERT_PATH=~/.docker/machine/machines/default
DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.99.100:2376
DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME=default
DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
```

If a list of environment variables are returned as above, this means that you're currently using `docker-machine` and any `docker` commands will be routed to the virtual machine controlled by `docker-machine`.

To switch from `docker-machine` to `docker-desktop-for-mac`, simply unset the above environment variables:

```shell
unset DOCKER_CERT_PATH DOCKER_HOST DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY
```

### Using a Development Image of the Container Registry

To test development versions of the container registry against GDK:

1. Within the [container registry](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry) project root, build and tag an image that includes your changes:

   ```shell
   docker build -t registry:dev .
   ```

1. Write the image tag in the `registry_image` file and reconfigure GDK:

   ```shell
   echo registry:dev > registry_image
   gdk reconfigure
   ```

1. Restart GDK:

   ```shell
   gdk restart
   ```

1. Inspect Docker to confirm that the development image of the registry is running locally:

   ```shell
   docker ps
   CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
   bc6c0efa5582        registry:dev        "registry serve /etcâ€¦"   7 seconds ago       Up 6 seconds                            romantic_nash
   ```
