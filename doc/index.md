# GDK documentation

GitLab Development Kit (GDK) provides a local environment for developing GitLab
and related projects.

Setting up GDK involves:

- [Installing dependencies](#install-dependencies)
- [Installing and setting up GDK](#install-and-set-up-gdk)

## Install dependencies

Before [setting up GDK](#install-and-set-up-gdk), your local environment must
have prerequisite third-party software installed and configured. Some
dependencies can be installed with a *package manager*.

You should regularly keep these dependencies up to date. Generally, the latest
versions of these dependencies work fine.

NOTE:
Install, configure, and update all of these dependencies as a non-root user. If
you don't know what a root user is, you very likely run everything as a non-root
user already.

The process for installing dependencies depends on your operating system.
We automatically install dependencies for the following operating systems as
part of the bootstrapping process which is described below:

- macOS
- Ubuntu
- Debian

[Advanced instructions](advanced.md) are also available, including instructions
for:

- [macOS](advanced.md#macos)
- [Ubuntu](advanced.md#ubuntu)
- [Debian](advanced.md#debian)
- [Other Linux distributions](advanced.md#install-other-linux-dependencies)
- [FreeBSD](advanced.md#install-freebsd-dependencies)
- [Windows 10](advanced.md#install-windows-10-dependencies)

## Install and set up GDK

Before attempting to use these steps, be sure you have [installed dependencies](#install-dependencies).

To get GDK up and running:

1. Ensure `git` and `make` are available. If you're on:
   - macOS, `git` and `make` are installed by default.
   - Ubuntu/Debian, run the following to install `git` and `make`:

     ```shell
     apt-get update && apt-get install git make
     ```

1. Clone the `gitlab-development-kit` repository into your preferred location:

   ```shell
   git clone https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit.git
   ```

1. Change into the newly-created GDK clone directory.
1. Install required software such as Ruby, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and so on:

   ```shell
   make bootstrap
   ```

1. Complete GDK installation by cloning and configuring GitLab and other projects
   using `gdk install`. Use one of the following methods:

   - For those who have write access to the [GitLab.org group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org) we
     recommend developing against the GitLab project (the default). To:
     - Clone `gitlab` using SSH (recommended), run:

       ```shell
       gdk install gitlab_repo=git@gitlab.com:gitlab-org/gitlab.git
       ```

     - Clone `gitlab` using HTTPS, run:

       ```shell
       gdk install
       ```

     Use `gdk install shallow_clone=true` for a faster clone that consumes less disk-space.
     The clone process uses [`git clone --depth=1`](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt---depthltdepthgt).

   - Other options, in order of recommendation:
     - Install using [a GitLab fork](#install-using-your-own-gitlab-fork).
     - Install using [the GitLab FOSS project](#install-using-gitlab-foss-project).

### Install using GitLab FOSS project

> Learn [how to create a fork](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/forking_workflow.html#creating-a-fork)
> of [GitLab FOSS](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss).

After cloning the `gitlab-development-kit` project and running `support/bootstrap`, to:

- Clone `gitlab-foss` using SSH, run:

  ```shell
  gdk install gitlab_repo=git@gitlab.com:gitlab-org/gitlab-foss.git
  ```

- Clone `gitlab-foss` using HTTPS, run:

  ```shell
  gdk install gitlab_repo=https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss.git
  ```

Use `gdk install shallow_clone=true` for a faster clone that consumes less disk
space. The clone process uses [`git clone --depth=1`](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt---depthltdepthgt).

### Install using your own GitLab fork

> Learn [how to create a fork](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/forking_workflow.html#creating-a-fork)
> of [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab).

After cloning the `gitlab-development-kit` project and running `support/bootstrap`, to:

- Clone your `gitlab` fork using SSH, run:

  ```shell
  # Replace <YOUR-NAMESPACE> with your namespace
  gdk install gitlab_repo=git@gitlab.com:<YOUR-NAMESPACE>/gitlab.git
  support/set-gitlab-upstream
  ```

- Clone your `gitlab` fork using HTTPS, run:

  ```shell
  # Replace <YOUR-NAMESPACE> with your namespace
  gdk install gitlab_repo=https://gitlab.com/<YOUR-NAMESPACE>/gitlab.git
  support/set-gitlab-upstream
  ```

The `set-gitlab-upstream` script creates a remote named `upstream` for
[the canonical GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab). It also
modifies `gdk update` (See [Update GitLab](gdk_commands.md#update-gitlab))
to pull down from the upstream repository instead of your fork, making it easier
to keep up-to-date with the project.

If you want to push changes from upstream to your fork, run `gdk update` and then
`git push origin` from the `gitlab` directory.

## Set up `gdk.test` hostname

`gdk.test` is the standard for referring to the local GDK instance in
documentation steps and GDK tools. To set up `gdk.test` as a hostname:

1. Map `gdk.test` to 127.0.0.1. For example, add the following to `/etc/hosts`:

   ```plaintext
   127.0.0.1 gdk.test
   ```

1. Add the following to `gdk.yml`:

   ```yaml
   hostname: gdk.test
   ```

1. Reconfigure GDK:

   ```shell
   gdk reconfigure
   ```

## Resolve installation errors

During the `gdk install` process, you may encounter some dependency-related
errors. If these errors occur:

- Run `gdk doctor`, which can detect problems and offer possible solutions.
- Refer to the [troubleshooting page](troubleshooting.md).
- [Open an issue in the GDK tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/issues).

## Use GitLab Enterprise features

Instructions to generate a developer license can be found in the
[onboarding documentation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/developer-onboarding/#working-on-gitlab-ee).

The license key generator is available only for GitLab team members, who should
use the **Sign in with GitLab** link using their `dev.gitlab.org` account.

For information about adding your license to GitLab, see
[Activate GitLab EE with a license](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/license.html)

## Post-installation

After successful installation, see:

- [GDK commands](gdk_commands.md).
- [GDK configuration](configuration.md).

After installation, [learn how to use GDK](howto/index.md) to enable other
features.

## Update GDK

For information about updating GDK, see [Update GDK](gdk_commands.md#update-gdk).

## Create new GDK

After you have set up GDK initially, you can create new *fresh installations*.
You might do this if you have problems with existing installation that are
complicated to fix, and you just need to get up and running quickly. To create a
fresh installation:

1. In the parent folder for GDK, run
   [`gdk init <new directory>`](#initialize-a-new-gdk-directory).
1. In the new directory, run [`gdk install`](#install-gdk-components).
